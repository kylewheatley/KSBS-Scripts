    <p>My name is <strong>Kyle Wheatley</strong>, and I am the Executive Director of the American Legion Boys State of Kansas. I would love to invite you to apply to attend <strong>Kansas Boys State</strong> this summer from <strong>June 1 - June 7</strong> on the campus of <strong>Kansas State University</strong>.</p>

    <p>Kansas Boys State is a fast-paced, fun leadership and teamwork experience that fosters self-identity, mutual respect, and civic responsibility. Through simulated elections, political parties, and government at various levels, you develop skills in leadership, public speaking, conflict resolution, and networking.</p>

    <p><strong>Kansas Boys State is <em>not</em> a politics or debate camp</strong>â€”it is a leadership experience that has something in it for every student. From the football field, to the stage, to the classroom and beyond, Kansas Boys State has something to offer you <strong>no matter your background</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Highlights and opportunities include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Earn 3 hours of college credit</strong> from Kansas State University at a deeply discounted price</li>
      <li>Attend a <strong>college and career fair</strong> with over <strong>40 colleges, universities, and trade schools</strong></li>
      <li>Complete up to <strong>7 Scouting Merit Badges</strong></li>
      <li>Join a <strong>band and choir</strong> directed by Kansas State University faculty members</li>
      <li>Apply for a <strong>$1,000 director's scholarship</strong> and other <strong>Kansas American Legion Scholarships</strong></li>
      <li>Apply for the <strong>$1,250 Kansas Samsung Scholarship</strong> (eligible for $5,000 regional & $10,000 national scholarships)</li>
      <li><strong>Earn guaranteed scholarships</strong> at local colleges and universities</li>
      <li>Attend <strong>morning strength & conditioning workouts</strong> for Fall sports requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The cost to attend is just <strong>$375</strong>, which covers <strong>food, housing, and programming for the week</strong>. Typically, you pay <strong>$50</strong>, and the remaining <strong>$325</strong> is covered by an <strong>American Legion Post or a community organization</strong> (e.g., Lions Club, Kiwanis Club, Rotary Club, Optimist Club, or even a church). If you need sponsorship help, <strong>apply anyway</strong>â€”we can help you find a sponsor!</p>

    <p>We would love to see you at Boys State this summer, where you'll join <strong>thousands of Kansans</strong> who have attended before you! A copy of our brochure is attached for you to see more about our program or visit our website to see a video about what a week at Boys State is like.</p>
